# File Upload Auto-Selection Testing Checklist

## Testing Steps for File Upload Implementation

### 1. Basic Flow Test
1. Navigate to Admin Panel → Upload by File
2. Upload multiple video files in Step 1 (FileDropper)
3. Proceed to Step 2 (file parsing)
4. Check Step 3 (upload forms) to verify files are auto-selected

### 2. Movie Upload Test
- [ ] Upload a movie file (e.g., "Movie Name (2023).mp4")
- [ ] Verify the movie form shows the file as pre-selected
- [ ] Check that the upload button shows "File Selected" or similar
- [ ] Verify video preview is generated if applicable

### 3. TV Show Upload Test
- [ ] Upload TV show episodes (e.g., "Show S01E01.mp4", "Show S01E02.mp4")
- [ ] Verify each episode form has the correct file pre-selected
- [ ] Check that episode upload buttons show correct status
- [ ] Test with different naming formats (S01E01, 1x01, etc.)

### 4. Edge Cases Test
- [ ] Test with missing files (filename in parsed data but no matching file)
- [ ] Test with extra files (uploaded files not in parsed data)
- [ ] Test with special characters in filenames
- [ ] Test with different file extensions (.mp4, .avi, .mkv)

### 5. Error Handling Test
- [ ] Verify graceful handling when no matching file is found
- [ ] Check console for any JavaScript errors
- [ ] Ensure UI doesn't break with mismatched files

### 6. User Experience Test
- [ ] Verify instructions reflect automatic file matching
- [ ] Check that users understand files are pre-selected
- [ ] Ensure manual file selection still works if needed

## Key Files to Monitor
- `AddByFile.js` - File passing to PrefilledUpload
- `PrefilledUpload.js` - File matching logic
- `UnifiedUploadModal.js` - Pre-filled file handling
- Browser console for errors

## Expected Behavior
✅ Files uploaded in Step 1 automatically appear in Step 3 upload forms
✅ No need for users to manually re-select the same files
✅ Clear visual indication when files are pre-selected
✅ Fallback to manual selection if auto-matching fails

## Status: READY FOR TESTING
Implementation complete - automatic file matching from Step 1 to Step 3 upload forms.
